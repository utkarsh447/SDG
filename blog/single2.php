                  <p style="font-family: Georgia;font-size: 18px;">Nisha, 18 years old lives in a dilapidated neighborhood inside Amritsar, with her family of six.
                  She is the third child to her parents and like her elder siblings she is also keen on studying. She is
                  a home science student and loves learning new things. This summer she undertook self training
                  in stitching, to sew clothes for herself to college. B.SC in Home Science was the course of her
                  choice and she loves what she is doing. Unlike her, her elder brother and sister who are from
                  Science backgrounds are unemployed in spite of having completed graduation. Her sister has
                  completed computer science engineering from a prestigious college is yet jobless and brother on
                  the other side is a diploma holder but runs a momo’s stall.
                  The unemployment statistics don’t need a glance when real stories like these live around us. How
                  are we supposed to achieve goals of ending poverty, hunger and health for all when there are no
                  jobs?
                  Nisha’s mother was a sole earner in the family with her packaging job in a factory, till quite
                  some time since her father is bed ridden but her elder brother took it upon himself to bring
                  money home by putting up a roadside stall.
                  This is pain to see capable individuals taking desperate measures to make ends meet. There are
                  numerous families like that of Nisha’s where poverty prevails in the face of qualifications due to
                  the lack of opportunities. Rising population is a concern as long as there are no enough
                  opportunities for all. It is hard to eradicate poverty without job opportunities at disposal. Even
                  though there are government schemes like MGNREGA, why government is lagging behind
                  generating jobs for urban dwellers? There are countless questions and immeasurable pain among
                  poverty stricken families living in cities. How education and skills are not enough to fulfill
                  aspirations of these families? Isn’t this how people drop out from schools to work as a daily
                  wage labors?
                  Six people living in a home with hardly any space to move and breathe, Nisha’s mother didn’t
                  take step back from providing her kids with best education. But was it worth it? She wonders day
                  in day out nevertheless she sends her youngest son to school without anguish.
                  Although circumstances are arduous for Nisha, she chooses to remain hopeful with a beaming
                  smile, that she will become a teacher one day.</p>
