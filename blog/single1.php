                  This might not apply to most of you reading this short snippet, but it surely hits upon
                  the transgender community of the society. These days male chauvinism is actively
                  competing with women who are striving their level best to achieve more than their
                  potential. The transgenders who are usually neglected and considered to be a curse for
                  the family they are born into, are now-a- days not struggling with all these negative
                  comments from all sides but are creating a pathway for themselves.<b>
                  Here is a memorable experience to share with all of you…..<b>
                  I used to visit a juice shop very often during my school days. Almost every alternate
                  day, a couple of transgenders would come and demand the juice makers for money.
                  They used to recite a few of their ‘slogans’ in chaste Tamil and by hook or crook get
                  the cash that they wanted. One day, a little girl observed this incident and was taken
                  aback upon looking at their appearance and attitude. She questioned her mother,
                  “Mama, who are these people ? Why are they so rude? Didn’t they learn manners
                  at school?” The mother had a tough time answering her daughter and moreover since
                  the kid was very inquisitive, she had a queue of questions regarding the transgenders.
                  She was lucky that her mother was patient and answered all her daughter’s queries.
                  One fact that remained etched in my mind was, “We need to say with one voice, that
                  transgender people are valued, they are loved, they are one among us. They desire
                  to be treated fairly and equally. After all its nature’s decision and not an
                  individual’s choice to be born as a transgender”. This tiny yet profound incident that
                  day, made me ponder over it (the rights of transgenders) for the following days after
                  that evening. Being a classical dancer (Bharatanatyam) myself, with an innate sense
                  of the intricacies of Indian art and culture, I was aware of the meritorious achievments
                  of the legendary transgender Bharatanatyam dancer, Ms. Narthaki Nataraj. Hailing
                  from Madurai, a temple town in Tamil Nadu, she has journeyed through a dark, long
                  tunnel of ridicule and rejection. Today, she is one of the leading artistes in the field of
                  Bharatanatyam and is recognised for propogating the pristine beauty of the Nayaki
                  Bhava tradition through her performances and most importantly through the
                  workshops that she conducts at her dance school which has its branches in the US,
                  UK and Canada apart from Chennai. I’ve had the opportunity of interacting with her
                  at a Dance Conference held during the world renowned December (Margazhi) Music
                  and Dance Festival of Madras. She spoke a few words on how dance has empowered
                  her to break barriers. To paraphrase her words, “Initially, she danced for identity, she
                  danced for a living… and now she dances for her soul”. I considered it a privilege to
                  have spent a few golden moments with her and in fact she blessed me with a

                  successful career in this traditional art form of Bharatanatyam and my academics as
                  well. </p>
